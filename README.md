# 👋 Hi
Welcome to the internal home of **Numeric Machines**. This repository serves as the organization-wide landing page and a resource hub for our development team.

## 🚀 Our Mission
We are building the next generation of magical technologies. As a team, we prioritize technical excellence, rapid iteration, and horizontal collaboration.

## 🛠 Internal Developer Resources
* **Documentation:** Get acquainted with our Notion Tech and App workspaces and always remember to add/update to documentation. 
* **Design System:** Please follow our Design System and ask Pranav if any question. 
* **Communication:** Please use the `Numeric-Tech` channel for updates, questions and everything else.

## 📜 Our Code of Conduct
To maintain a high-performing and healthy engineering culture, we adhere to these core principles:

### 1. Radical Candor
We believe in giving and receiving direct, actionable feedback. Challenge ideas directly, but care about each other personally.

### 2. Bias for Action
In the face of ambiguity, we prefer a "v1" that works over a perfect "v0" that never ships. Document your decisions, but keep moving.

### 3. Ownership & Accountability
If you see a bug or a gap in documentation, you own the fix. We don't say "that's not my job."

### 4. Respectful Collaboration
* **Code Reviews:** Treat PRs as a teaching tool, not a gatekeeping mechanism. Be kind and constructive.
* **Inclusivity:** We are a global team. Respect different time zones, cultural backgrounds, and communication styles.
* **Disagreement:** It is okay to disagree. However, once a decision is made, we "disagree and commit" to move the project forward.
